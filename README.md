# README

This readme is about my new hood cleaning directory.  I am building this out so that companies in the hood cleaning business can have a marketplace to be found more easily.

* Ruby version: 2.4.0

* Rails version: 5.4.0

* System dependencies: none

This should be a great place for links to some of my hood cleaning sites too:

* [Hood Cleaning Denver](https://procohoodcleaning.com)

* [Hood Cleaning Seattle](https://seattlehoodcleaningpros.com)

* [Hood Cleaning Miami](https://miamihoodcleaningpros.com)

I need to get this directory done quickly. It will be interesting to see if I can make something really fast and simple.
